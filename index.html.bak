                <p>It is time to get up and <strong>work on my own growth</strong>! Here, I can begin applying some of my newly gained knowledge to try and make some waves in my life, which has been frozen in place for a very long time.</p>
                <p>I am not a native English speaker, but I will keep trying my best to convey my ideas and feelings in this wonderful language that connects us all around the globe. Please, bear with me and my weird mannerism. Also, this is more than a blog or a place for my projects, this is a small and special part of my mind transcribed into barebone pages filled with aspirations, dreams and boilerplate. Expect more honesty than greatness around here.</p>
